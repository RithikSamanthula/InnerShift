            <p class="lead mental-health-about">
              Mental health refers to a person's overall psychological
              well-being. It encompasses emotional, social, and cognitive
              aspects of a person's life and can affect how they think, feel,
              and behave. Good mental health allows individuals to cope with the
              normal stresses of life, work productively, and make positive
              contributions to their communities. On the other hand, poor mental
              health can lead to a range of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral
              issues, such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and suicidal
              thoughts. It is important to take care of one's mental health as
              it is essential for a fulfilling and productive life.

            <p class="lead mental-illnessess-about">
              Mental illness refers to a wide range of conditions that affect a
              person's mood, thinking, behavior, and overall mental health.
              Mental illnesses can be caused by a variety of factors, including
              genetics, environmental factors, and life experiences. Examples of
              mental illnesses include depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar
              disorder, schizophrenia, and eating disorders, among others. These
              conditions can have a significant impact on a person's daily life,
              making it difficult for them to function in their personal,
              social, and professional relationships. Treatment for mental
              illness often involves a combination of medication, therapy, and
              lifestyle changes. It is important to seek professional help if
              you or someone you know is struggling with a mental health
              condition.
